Hi, I'm lyremelody, l8y for short.

Many years ago, I came to name a internet id for myself. 
I choose the word 'lyre'. But the id 'lyre' seems to be very popular, so I add the 'melody' to the word 'lyre', it's 'lyremelody'.

'l8y' is an abbreviation derived by replacing the 8 letters ¡°yremelod¡± with ¡°8¡±.
Of course, the idea is from kubernetes(k8s).
